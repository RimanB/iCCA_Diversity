# iCCA_Diversity
Exploring analysis and final results
iCCA classification: cell differentiation-based: Morphology and/or phenotype
SBD: interlobular and steptal duct 
CLC: Bile ductules/CoH
DPM: DPM 
HCC-like, iCCA with morphological features resembing classical HCC. 

Evaluate in 5% increasements
Group classifcation: 
 1. SBD (>95%) = pure SBD 
 2. cSBD-CLC (5% < CLC <= 80%] without DPM 
 3. CLC, CLC >80% (consensus paper, WHO) 
 4. iCCA with DPM, >5% DPM 
 5. HCC-like (>95% Hepatoid/HCC-like pattern
 In addition: All iCCA with > 5% CLC => iCCA with CLC pattern
Note CLC = bile ductular (BD) in some codes
